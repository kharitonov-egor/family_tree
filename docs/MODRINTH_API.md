# Modrinth API — Publishing Guide

How to publish new versions of Family Tree to Modrinth via the API.
Sources: https://docs.modrinth.com/api/ and https://docs.modrinth.com/guide/oauth/

## Basics

- **Base URL:** `https://api.modrinth.com` (production), `https://staging-api.modrinth.com` (testing)
- **Rate limit:** 300 requests/minute per IP (`X-Ratelimit-Limit` / `-Remaining` / `-Reset` headers)
- **User-Agent header is mandatory** and must uniquely identify the app, e.g.
  `egakh/family_tree/0.3.1 (ega.khar@gmail.com)`. Vague agents (e.g. `okhttp/4.9.3`) may be blocked.
- Project/version IDs are eight-character base62 strings. Slugs work too but can change — prefer IDs in scripts.

## Authentication

Two options; **a Personal Access Token (PAT) is the right choice for publishing our own releases** (OAuth is for multi-user apps).

### Personal Access Token (recommended)

1. Create at https://modrinth.com/settings/pats
2. Grant scopes: `VERSION_CREATE` (create versions), `VERSION_FILE_WRITE` (upload files). Add `PROJECT_WRITE` only if editing project metadata.
3. Send it in the header (note: no `Bearer` prefix for PATs):

```
Authorization: mrp_xxxxxxxx
```

Wrong/missing scopes return `401`. Never commit the token.

**This repo's token lives in `.env` (gitignored) as `MODRINTH_TOKEN`.** Read it from there when publishing, e.g. in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:MODRINTH_TOKEN = (Get-Content .env | Where-Object { $_ -match '^MODRINTH_TOKEN=' }) -replace '^MODRINTH_TOKEN=', ''
```

### OAuth2 (only for apps acting on behalf of other users)

1. Register the app at https://modrinth.com/settings/applications — set scopes and redirect URIs; you get a client ID and secret. Regenerate the secret immediately if it ever leaks.
2. Send the user to `https://modrinth.com/auth/authorize` with query params:
   `response_type=code`, `client_id`, `scope` (space-separated, `+`-joined), `redirect_uri`, optional `state` (CSRF protection).
3. After approval the user is redirected back with a `code`.
4. Exchange it: `POST https://api.modrinth.com/_internal/oauth/token` with
   `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, client secret in the Authorization header, and form fields `code`, `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `grant_type=authorization_code`.
5. Response: `access_token`, `token_type` (`Bearer`), `expires_in`. Use as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Scope identifiers are listed in the Labrinth source: `apps/labrinth/src/models/v3/pats.rs`.

## Key endpoints

| Purpose | Endpoint | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| Get project | `GET /v2/project/{id_or_slug}` | none (public) |
| Get / list versions | `GET /v2/version/{id}` · `GET /v2/project/{id_or_slug}/version` | none (public) |
| Create version + upload jar | `POST /v2/version` (multipart) | `VERSION_CREATE` |
| Add a file to an existing version | `POST /v2/version/{id}/file` (multipart) | `VERSION_FILE_WRITE` |
| Edit a version (e.g. `game_versions`, `changelog`) | `PATCH /v2/version/{id}` (JSON) | `VERSION_WRITE` |

Project id is `CVQKDAe7`. The current released version id is discoverable via the list endpoint (e.g. `9j4QmEV4` was `0.3.2`).

## Multi-version jars (Stonecutter)

The build produces one jar **per Minecraft version**: `versions/<mcver>/build/libs/familytree-<modver>+<mcver>.jar` (see `CLAUDE.md`). Build them with `./gradlew buildAll` — you may run this build yourself when publishing a release. On Modrinth a single *version* carries one `game_versions` + `loaders` list that applies to **all** its files, so there are two layouts:

- **One Modrinth version per Minecraft version** (recommended, cleanest): `POST /v2/version` once per jar, with `version_number` like `0.3.3+26.2` and `game_versions: ["26.2"]`. Users only ever see the jar for their MC version.
- **Multiple files on one Modrinth version** (what `0.3.2` currently does): keep one version, add the other MC's jar with `POST /v2/version/{id}/file`, and `PATCH` its `game_versions` to list every supported MC. Simpler, but Modrinth can't tell which file is for which MC, so users on any listed version see all jars and must pick the right `+<mcver>` one.

### Add a file to an existing version + extend its game versions

```bash
# 1) extend the version's game_versions
curl -X PATCH "https://api.modrinth.com/v2/version/9j4QmEV4" \
  -H "Authorization: $MODRINTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "User-Agent: egakh/family_tree/<modver> (ega.khar@gmail.com)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"game_versions":["26.1.1","26.2"]}'          # returns 204

# 2) upload the extra jar (data part just names the file part)
curl -X POST "https://api.modrinth.com/v2/version/9j4QmEV4/file" \
  -H "Authorization: $MODRINTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "User-Agent: egakh/family_tree/<modver> (ega.khar@gmail.com)" \
  -F 'data={"file_parts":["file"]};type=application/json' \
  -F "file=@versions/26.2/build/libs/familytree-<modver>+26.2.jar;type=application/java-archive"   # returns 204
```

`PATCH` needs the `VERSION_WRITE` scope; the file upload needs `VERSION_FILE_WRITE`. If either 401s, the PAT is missing that scope.

## Publishing a brand-new version

`POST /v2/version` takes multipart form data: a `data` part with JSON metadata, plus one part per file (a jar from `versions/<mcver>/build/libs/`). Build with `./gradlew buildAll` — you may run this build yourself when publishing a release.

`data` JSON fields:

```json
{
  "project_id": "CVQKDAe7",
  "version_number": "0.3.1",
  "name": "Family Tree 0.3.1",
  "changelog": "Markdown changelog here",
  "dependencies": [],
  "game_versions": ["26.1.1"],
  "version_type": "release",
  "loaders": ["fabric"],
  "featured": true,
  "file_parts": ["file"],
  "primary_file": "file"
}
```

`version_number` is based on `mod_version` in `gradle.properties`; for a per-MC version use the `<modver>+<mcver>` form (e.g. `0.3.3+26.2`) and set `game_versions` to that single MC. It must be **unique** per project — you cannot reuse a `version_number` that already exists. `version_type` is `release`, `beta`, or `alpha`.

Example with curl (one MC version):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.modrinth.com/v2/version" \
  -H "Authorization: $MODRINTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "User-Agent: egakh/family_tree/0.3.3 (ega.khar@gmail.com)" \
  -F 'data={"project_id":"CVQKDAe7","version_number":"0.3.3+26.2","name":"Family Tree 0.3.3 (26.2)","changelog":"...","dependencies":[],"game_versions":["26.2"],"version_type":"release","loaders":["fabric"],"featured":true,"file_parts":["file"],"primary_file":"file"};type=application/json' \
  -F "file=@versions/26.2/build/libs/familytree-0.3.3+26.2.jar;type=application/java-archive"
```

Test against the staging API first if unsure. Verify afterwards with `GET /v2/project/{id}/version` and on the project page.

## Release layout for 1.0.0

Publish one release per target: `1.0.0+1.21.1`, `1.0.0+26.1.1`, `1.0.0+26.2`, and `1.0.0+26.2-neoforge`. Set each release's Minecraft version and loader to that target only. Fabric builds require project `P7dR8mSH`, Fabric API. NeoForge has no Fabric API dependency. Use the JSON field `name` for the release title.

Update the project description through `PATCH /v2/project/CVQKDAe7` with `body` and `description`. This needs `PROJECT_WRITE`. Add media with `POST /v2/project/CVQKDAe7/gallery?ext=webp&featured=false&title=...`, sending raw image bytes. Read the resulting project gallery to get the CDN URL for the page body. Gallery files must be at most 5 MiB. Use `PATCH` on the same gallery endpoint with the image `url` to change its title, ordering, or featured status.

## Verified publication for 1.1.0

Use `python scripts/release_manifest.py` after committing the tested source, then `python scripts/publish_modrinth.py --manifest build/releases/1.1.0/manifest.json`. It publishes one version per target and checks every jar against its recorded SHA-512. Reruns verify existing versions instead of uploading duplicates.

Use `--media docs/media.json` to upload the reviewed gallery assets, `--fix-archive` to correct Fabric API requirements on old versions, and `--update-page` to apply `modrinth_description.md`. Gallery PATCH calls require the image URL in the query string, not the JSON body. The publisher keeps the token out of its output.

Fabric targets are 1.21.1, 26.1.1, 26.1.2, 26.2, and 26.3. NeoForge targets are 1.21.1, 26.2, and 26.3. NeoForge 26.3 is beta because its tested loader is beta. Use the actual jar copies under the manifest directory for both Modrinth and GitHub.
